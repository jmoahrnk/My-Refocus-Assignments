Good Day! 

I'm John Mark and I'm currently learning to be a web developer.

I like reading and coding a lot.

This year, I hope to finish my learnings and start applying them by working on different projects.

I'd like to prepare for a career that I enjoy, with the possibility of working for different clients from different parts of the world.
